🌱 Hey, I’m @GiaHan – Code Weaver & Curiosity Chaser
👋 Welcome to my little corner of the digital wilds! I’m a wandering soul obsessed with tech and creativity, always tinkering with something magical—be it lines of code, jaw-dropping designs, or the elegant dance of data.

👀 What Lights Me Up
Code Magic: Crafting UIs that sparkle and back-ends that hum. FullStack is my playground!
Design Vibes: Turning ideas into visuals that make you go “whoa.”
Data Dances: Watching numbers twist into stories—algorithms are my poetry.
🌱 Currently Leveling Up
I’m diving deeper into FullStack every day—building, breaking, and rebuilding with a grin. A little progress, a lot of fun. Right now, I’m mastering the art of seamless front-to-back flow—think slick React fronts and sturdy Node.js backs.

✨ Why This Space is Special
This is my sandbox, my sketchbook, my spellbook. Every repo here is a step in my journey—some polished, some messy, all me. Peek around, fork something, or drop me a line if you wanna chat tech, creativity, or the wild chaos of learning!
